## Getting Started

To get the project up and running locally, follow these steps:

### Development Profile

1. **Clone this repository.**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/endo-server.git
   ```
 Navigating to the Project Directory
```sh
cd endo-server
```

Installing Project Dependencies
```sh
mvn clean install
```
Configuring SMTP Settings
Configure SMTP settings in the development properties file (application-dev.properties or application-dev.yml) for email functionality during development.

Running the Spring Boot Application with the Development Profile
```sh
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=dev
```
Production Profile

Cloning the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/endo-server.git
```
Navigating to the Project Directory
```sh
cd endo-server
```
Installing Project Dependencies
```sh
mvn clean install
```
Configuring SMTP Settings
Configure SMTP settings in the production properties file (application-prod.properties or application-prod.yml) for email functionality during production.

Running the Spring Boot Application with the Production Profile
sh
Copy code
mvn spring-boot:run -Dspring.profiles.active=prod
Configurations
External Configuration Files
You can pass configurations to the application using external property files. Create an application.properties or application.yml file and specify your configuration properties there. For example:


```sh
# Database Configuration
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
spring.datasource.username=dbuser
spring.datasource.password=dbpassword

# SMTP Configuration
spring.mail.host=smtp.example.com
spring.mail.port=587
spring.mail.username=email@example.com
spring.mail.password=emailpassword
```
Docker
To run the application in a Docker container, follow these steps:

Build the Docker image.

```sh
docker build -t endo-server .
```
Run the Docker container.

```sh
docker run -p 8080:8080 endo-server
```
Kubernetes
You can deploy the application to Kubernetes using Kubernetes manifests or Helm charts. Ensure you have a Kubernetes cluster set up.

Create Kubernetes resources using manifests or Helm charts.
```sh
# Using manifests
kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f service.yaml
```
```sh
# OR using Helm
helm install endo-server ./endo-server-chart
```
